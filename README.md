Gutenberg Dynamic Image Generator for Fly Image Resizer
=======================================================

#### Note: This Plugin accompanies [Fly Dynamic Image Resizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fly-dynamic-image-resizer/) by Junaid Bhura.

## The Problem

Fly Dynamic Image resizer allows developers to generate specific sizes depending upon need rather than rely upon WordPressâ€™ set media sizes. These are typically rendered via `fly_get_attachment_image_src` function calls. In Gutenberg, these don't work because everything is generated client-side and then saved to post content. To handle custom sizes in our Gutenberg blocks, we have written an API call that allows these images to be generated when blocks are created (see below).

However, if a user ever clears the Fly Images folder, these images will not be deleted and then never resized again unless the user goes and edits the block. (i.e. All images will 404!) :weary:

## The Solution :raised_hands:

This plugin creates a custom endpoint so that when a fly image is called, the server will route the request to a custom endpoint that re-generates the image _if it doesn't exist_.

In short, imagine a source image is: `https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/1234/hero-home@2x-606x200.jpg`)`

1. If the image exists, it is simply returned from the server as usual (the endpoint is never hit).
2. If the image does _not_ exist:
	- The image is generated and saved to the `fly-images` folder with the appropriate width, height and cropping, so that the image will exist for subsequent visitors.
	- The image binary is returned in the response so that the original requester receives the image as well (albeit slightly slower because the image must be generated)

That's it!

## Setup :hammer:

1. Install the plugin into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Add the following Rewrite Rule depending upon your web server type. **Important:** Many plugins (e.g. WebP Express) will add additional, overriding `.htaccess` directives within the `uploads` folder. This may require placing this rewrite there instead of at the root `.htaccess` file. (See below for specific plugin instructions)

### Apache

````
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.(webp)$ 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule . /index.php?esc-fly-image-generate=1 [L]
</IfModule>

# Or For Multisite
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/. [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/uploads/sites/\d+\/fly-images/.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.(webp)$ 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule . /index.php?esc-fly-image-generate=1 [L]
</IfModule>
````
### Nginx

````
    location ^~ /wp-content/uploads/fly-images/ {
        try_files $uri /index.php?esc-fly-image-generate=1;
    }
````

## Use in your Gutenberg Blocks

You can also call the following REST API endpoints from within your own blocks to generate images.

### Single Image (returns 1x and 2x)

`GET /wp-json/esc/v1/dynamic-images/<ImageId>/<Width>/<Height>/<Cropping?>`

**Note: You _cannot_ go to this endpoint directly - you must be logged in to WordPress and in the editor view for the permissions to be satisfied**

#### Example

`/wp-json/esc/v1/dynamic-images/100/200/150/lc`  would:

* Resize Image with ID of `100`
* restrict width to `100` pixels
* restrict height to `150`
* Crop from Left-Center

(Note a retina-sized image of 400 x 300 would also be generated)

You may use one of the following arguments; erroneous arguments will result in a 400 error.

| Argument 	| Cropping Origin  	|
|----		|---		|
|  `c`  		|  Center 		|
|  `cc`  		|  Center 		|
|  `lc`  		|  Left-Center 		|
|  `rc`  		|  Right-Center 		|
|  `lt` 		|  Left-Top 		|
|  `ct`  		|  Center-Top 		|
|  `rt`  		|  Right-Top 		|
|  `lb`  		|  Left-Bottom	|
|  `cb`  		|  Center-Bottom	|
|  `rb`  		|  Right-Bottom	|

### Multiple Images (returns 1x and 2x)

`POST /wp-json/esc/v1/dynamic-images/`

Send a `POST` request as a JSON array containing the same arguments above as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 435, //Image ID
        "width": 400, //Width in pixels (or null)
        "height": null, //Height in pixels (or null)
        "crop": "lc", //Cropping or false/null/empty for no cropping
        "ref": "image-435" //A handle returned in the response (optional)
    },
    {
        "id": 345,
        "width": 600,
        "height": 400,
        "crop": "rb",
        "ref": "some-other-image"
    }
]
````

Your response will look like this:

```json
{
    "image-435": {
        "1x": {
            "src": "https://YOURURL.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/435/cross-promo@2x-400x0-lc.png",
            "width": 400,
            "height": 193
        },
        "2x": {
            "src": "https://YOURURL.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/435/cross-promo@2x-800x0-lc.png",
            "width": 800,
            "height": 386
        }
    },
    "some-other-image": {
        "1x": {
            "src": "https://YOURURL.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/345/event-card-600x400-rb.png",
            "width": 588,
            "height": 400
        },
        "2x": {
            "src": "https://YOURURL.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/345/event-card-1200x800-rb.png",
            "width": 588,
            "height": 441
        }
    }
}

## Help Wanted :grin:

1. Allow the `.htaccess` rule to be written upon installation and removed when uninstalled.

## How to Use With Other Plugins

### WebP Express Rewrite

First, set up the WebP Express Settings as follows: 

1. **Destination Folder**: Mingled
2. **File Extension**: Append .webp
3. **Destination Structure**: Image Roots
4. **Create WebP Files on Request**: Checked.

Click "Save settings in force new .htaccess rules"

Once complete, add the following at the top of the .htaccess file generated by WebP Express _inside your uploads folder_. This allows the fly image to be created first if it doesn't exist, then the webp will be created on a subsequent request. After both have been created, the server will simply serve up the image files without hitting the conversion script.

```
# Fly First...
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond wp-content/uploads/fly-images/$1$2 !-f 
RewriteRule ^fly-images/(.*)(\.jpe?g|\.png)(\.webp)?$ /index.php?esc-fly-image-generate=1 [L]
```
