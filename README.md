Gutenberg Image Resizer for Fly Image Resizer
=============================================

#### Note: This Plugin accompanies [Fly Dynamic Image Resizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fly-dynamic-image-resizer/) by Junaid Bhura.

## The Problem

Fly Dynamic Image resizer allows developers to generate specific sizes depending upon need rather than rely upon WordPressâ€™ set media sizes. We have written an API call that allows these images to be generated when blocks are created. :weary:

However, if a user ever clears the Fly Images folder, these images will not be resized.

## The Solution :raised_hands:

This plugin creates a custom endpoint so that when a fly image is called (e.g. `https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/1234/hero-home@2x-606x200.jpg`):

1. If the image exists, it is simply returned from the server (the endpoint is never hit)
2. If the image does _not_ exist:
	- The image is generated and saved to the fly folder, so the image will exist for subsequent users.
	- The image binary is returned in the response.

That's it!

## Setup :hammer:

1. Install the plugin into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Add the following Rewrite Rule:

````
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule . /index.php?esc-fly-image-generate=1 [L]
</IfModule>
````

## Help Wanted :grin:

1. Create an Nginx configuration
2. Allow the `.htaccess` rule to be written upon installation and removed upon unistallation.
